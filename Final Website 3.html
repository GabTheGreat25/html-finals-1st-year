<div class ="desc"> <strong>Hydropower</strong> which converts the energy from flowing water into electricity, is a green energy source that does not emit greenhouse gases or create air pollution. It is flexible because the output of hydropower plants can easily be adjusted based on current needs. In addition to being a sustainable form of energy, hydropower can also help with flood control, irrigation and water supply.</div>
</div>

<img src ="Images/ForSolar.JPG" alt ="Solar">
<div class ="desc"> <strong>Solar Energy</strong> is sourced from the sun using solar panels. It is one of the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy sources. Not only can it generate electricity, it can also be used to heat water for commercial or domestic purposes. When sunlight is low, solar energy is best complemented with flexible power plants like natural gas.</div>

<img src ="Images/ForWind.JPG" alt ="Wind">
<div class ="desc"> <strong>Wind Energy</strong> utilizes turbines to capture kinetic energy from wind to generate electricity. Aside from being a renewable source of energy, wind power has one of the lowest environmental impacts compared to other sources, as it produces zero emissions, and also saves billions of gallons of water every year as wind turbines don’t require water to produce energy or to cool down equipment.</div>
</div>

<img src ="Images/ForGeo.jpg" alt ="Geo">
<div class ="desc"> <strong>Geothermal power</strong> plants use the steam from beneath the earth’s surface to power turbines and generate electricity. Unlike coal plants, which burn fossil fuels to create steam, geothermal plants simply use the high temperatures from the earth’s core to do the job, and are thus a source of clean, renewable energy. The Philippines, being part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, is particularly abundant with this form of power generation.</div>

<img src ="Images/Hydrogen.webp" alt ="Hydro">
<div class ="desc"> <strong>Hydrogen</strong> has tremendous potential as a fuel and energy source. Hydrogen is the most common element on Earth for example, water is two-thirds hydrogen but in nature, it is always found in combination with other elements. Once separated from other elements, hydrogen can be used to power vehicles, replace natural gas for heating and cooking, and generate electricity.</div>

<img src ="Images/Water.webp" alt ="Hydro">
<div class ="desc"> <strong>Ocean Energy</strong> provides several forms of renewable energy, and each one is driven by different forces. Energy from ocean waves and tides can be harnessed to generate electricity, and ocean thermal energy—from the heat stored in seawater—can also be converted to electricity. Using current technologies, most ocean energy is not cost-effective compared to other renewable energy sources.</div>
